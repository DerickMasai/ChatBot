# ü§ñ ChatBot v1.0

<img src="https://derickmasai.com/src/img/portfolio/github_chatbot.png">

ChatBot is a fully open-source easy-to-install bot that is designed to handle the common day-to-day inquiries a business' customers may have so it's support team can handle the more involved challenges their clients are experiencing.

According to a study listed on [Trajectory](https://www.trajectorywebdesign.com/blog/should-my-website-have-a-faq-page/ "Trajectory"), 51% of customers expect a business to be available 24/7, 75% of online customers expect help within five minutes, 54% of customers have used email as a customer service channel in the past year, and customers expect businesses to respond to their emails within an hour. It isn't a stretch to say most of these emails are usually support-related and so having a chatbot simply automates this process.

Most customers simply want to be heard and so a bot answering their queries provides that "human" experience while also, from a UX perspective, being a win since they don't have to find the FAQ page, if the site even has one, that is usually hidden on the footer section of the site which, as [UseItBetter](https://www.useitbetter.com/blog/using-scroll-reach-to-evaluate-landing-page/ "UseItBetter") cites in their report, about 50% of a site's audience never even get to.

## ‚ÅâÔ∏è How it Works

So how does this all work, do I have to head on to YouTube University and learn programming real quick to use?

Nope! All you need is to simply copy and paste this üëá single line of code to the HEAD element, or put simply, before this "</head>" tag on any page you want to add the bot and it will do the rest! Pretty simple, right? 

```html
<script src="https://chatbot.derickmasai.com/src/js/chatbot.min.js"></script>
```

This is a work in progress that is also meant to showcase my skills so any constructive feedback is more than encouraged and welcome.

## üöÄ Tech Used

PHP for the backend functionality, AlpineJS for the light scripting required and TailwindCSS for the UI.
